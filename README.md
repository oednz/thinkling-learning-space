# Thinkling Learning Space
## Web-based, Collaborative, Rich Media Curation and Presentation Tool for Educators and Students  

Thinkling Learning Space is a modified version of Spacedeck Open (https://github.com/spacedeck/spacedeck-open), based specifically on master branch up to commit 79a3d39. 
The first commit of this modified version incorporates minor bug fixes, improvements in the UI, and one new feature for now. The overall aim is to align more closely to the needs and requirements of the education community.
Further fixes, modifications and new features are expected as we receive feedback from users while relying on code contributions and collaboration from the technical community.
